 > Hi Bruce and TA folks,
 > While I was working on "." and ".." logic, I stumbled on something interesting.

 > ice% find . -name .

 > ---------
 > ice% find ./ -name .
 > ---------
 > ice% find ~lib215/hw/pfind -name pfind
 > /home/l/i/lib215/hw/pfind
 > find: /home/l/i/lib215/hw/pfind/pft2.d/d1/locked.directory: Permission denied
 > find: /home/l/i/lib215/hw/pfind/pft2.d/d2/d2: Permission denied
 > ---------
 > ice% find ~lib215/hw/pfind/ -name pfind
 > find: /home/l/i/lib215/hw/pfind/pft2.d/d1/locked.directory: Permission denied
 > find: /home/l/i/lib215/hw/pfind/pft2.d/d2/d2: Permission denied

 > My understanding from the above is that find compares the final 
   dirname in the starting_search_dir with search_str and displays 
   them if they match(cases 2 and 4 confirm that it does a strcmp).
 > I have added a new Test Scenario (case 5) in test.pfind which I 
   think would be a good test.
