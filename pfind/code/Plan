Project : pfind

Purpose : searches the directory for specified file type or file name/pattern.
	  pfind [directory] [options]
	  
	  options: -name , -type

Outline : opens the directory, reads the directroy, gets entry
          matches the type and pattern with entry, if so prints the file

Arguments:
       accepts a directory and options -name and -type
       option -name : expects a filename or a search pattern (e.g. *.c)
       option -type : expects a file type {f|d|c|b|p|l|s}

       if directory is '.' pfind searches current directory
Output :
      lists all the files that matches the type and pattern
      if no pattern is specified lists all the files in the directory and
      subdirectories.

Data Structures :
      

Program Flow:
      recursive search is done on the user specified directory

      Following are the steps how recursion is done 
      START - search routine:
      1. lstat on the passed in file
      2. check if the file matches the type and file pattern that user specified
      3. if match is obtained print the file path
      4. check if the file is a directory
      5. if yes 
      	   a open the directory
	   b read the directory, get the directory entry
	   c skip the . (current direcotry) and .. (parent directory) entries
	   d malloc a string and append the entry with previous path
	       - go to START with new entry as base file name and new path.
	       	 i.e. recurse on search
           e free string

      recurse till all the subdirectories and files are checked.
