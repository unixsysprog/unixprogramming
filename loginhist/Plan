You must submit one of these.

Project: dumputmp 

Purpose: A program to display the contents of a utmp file in human-readable form

Outline:
	dumputmp reads the utmp file record by record and 
        presents the contents in human-readable form.  The
        form of output is one line per record with fixed-width fields,
        all in text.
        dumputmp uses read to get data from the file, and uses
        printf to format and output results.

Output:
	The output looks like:
           logname, tty, pid, type, text version of type, time, host

Arguments:
	dumputmp accepts one command line argument, a file to dump.
        If no filename is given, dumputmp processes UTMP_FILE as defined
        in utmp.h

Input:
        dumputmp does not accept any user input; the datafile is the
        only source of input

Data Structures:
        dumputmp reads and writes one record at a time.  It only needs
        to store a single record, so one variable of type struct utmp
        is used.

Files:
        dumputmp reads a file of utmp records.  See Arguments and Input
        sections above.
