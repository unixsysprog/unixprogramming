Project: smsh

Purpose: This is subset of sh. This takes input from user and executes.

	 ./smsh  [FILENAME]

	 - if FILENAME is passed then smsh understands that it has to read 
	   from that file which is a script file
	 - if FILENAME is not provided then smsh reads from stdin.
	 
Operations:

1. cd builtin:
   calls unix function chdir() with the path specified after cd.
   if success returns 0 else returns -1.


2. exit builtin:
   calls unix _exit(). if a value is passed argument, convert the string to
   integer using strtol() and then pass the number to _exit() function.

3. read builtin:
   - reads the argument that is passed with read.This is the variable. 
   - calls next_cmd() in splitline with FILE* = stdin
   - gets the line from next_cmd(). This is the value.
   - stores the variable and value using VLstore()

4. comments:
   - after next_cmd() returns the line
   - check for the first character of the line
   - if it is '#' then it is a comment
      - continue
