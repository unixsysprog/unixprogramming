<h3>
The Four-Backslash Problem
</h3>
	<blockquote>
	When you type  <tt>echo \\</tt> to the bourne shell, it
	prints back <tt>\</tt> which is what you would expect.
	If you type  <tt>echo \\\\</tt> to the bourne shell, it
	prints back <tt>\</tt> which is not what I would expect.
	Asking for six backslashes produces two.
	<p>
	What is going on?

	<blockquote>
	The man page ( <tt>man 1b sh</tt> ) says, in the section on
	quoting:
	<pre>
  Quoting Mechanisms


  The following	characters have	a special meaning to the shell and cause ter-
  mination of a	word unless quoted:

       ; &amp; ( ) | ^ &lt; &gt; &lt;newline&gt; &lt;space&gt; &lt;tab&gt;

  Using	' ' (single) and " " (double) quotes to	surround a string or a \
  (backslash) before a single character	enables	the character to stand for
  itself, instead of conveying special meaning to the shell.

  Within single	quotes,	all characters (except the single quote	character
  itself), are taken literally,	with any special meaning removed.  Thus,
  entering:

       stuff='echo $? $*; ls * | wc'

  results only in the literal string echo $? $*; ls * |	wc being assigned to
  the stuff variable; the echo,	ls, and	wc commands are	not executed, nor are
  the variables	$? and $* and the special character * expanded by the shell.

  To verify this you could export the variable stuff with the command export
  stuff, and then use the command printenv stuff to view it.  This is differ-
  ent from the simple command echo $stuff.

  Within double	quotes,	the special meaning of certain characters ($, `, and
  ") does persist, while all other characters are taken	literally. Thus,
  within double	quotes,	command	and variable substitution takes	place.	In
  addition, the	quotes do not affect the commands within a command substitu-
  tion that is part of the quoted string, so characters	there retain their
  special meanings.

  Consider the following sequence:

  You enter:

       ls *

  System displays:

       file1
       file2
       file3

  You enter:

       message="This directory contains	`ls * `	"
       echo $message

  System displays:

       This directory contains file1 file2 file3

  This shows that the *	special	character inside the command substitution was
  expanded.

  <font color=blue>
  To hide the special meaning of $, `, and " within double quotes, precede
  these	characters with	a \ (backslash). Outside of double quotes, preceding
  a character with \ (backslash) is equivalent to placing it within single
  quotes.  Hence, a \ (backslash) immediately preceding	the newline character
  (that	is, a \	(backslash) at the end of the line) hides the newline charac-
  ter and allows you to	continue the command line on the next physical line.
  </font>
</pre>
	Notice the section in blue.  It says that <tt>\x</tt> is equivalent
        to "x" .  If that is true, then  <tt>\\</tt> must be equivalent
	to <tt>"\"</tt>   which is an un-terminated string.

<h4>
What does the Source Say?
</h4>
<blockquote>
	The source to the bourne shell looks a little odd.  This is the
	code that handles reading in the next word from input.  If you
	trace through this, you may see that the first <tt>\\</tt> actually
	turns into <tt>""</tt>.
