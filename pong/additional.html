	<b>Required Modularity for Pong</b>

<b>New Required Part of Pong Assignment</b>
<blockquote>
The pong assignment suggests taking a modular/object approach to the
paddle in the game.  This suggestion has been promoted to a requirement.
Here are the details.
</blockquote>
<b>The Original Description</b>
<blockquote>
The assignment suggests defining a data structure for a paddle and then says:
<p>
Having created the paddle data structure, you need to write a few
simple operations for it:  <tt>init_paddle()</tt>, <tt>up_paddle()</tt>,
<tt>down_paddle()</tt>, and <tt>is_a_hit(y,x)</tt>.  The <tt>init_paddle()</tt>
function must initialize the paddle data structure and draw it on the
screen.  The up and down functions should check if there is space to
move the paddle in the requested direction, and if there is, to
</blockquote>
<b>The Revised, Clarified Requirement</b>
<blockquote>
You must implement the paddle as a separate C file, called <tt>paddle.c</tt>.  That 
file is required to:
<ul><li>use static data to store the state of the paddle, preventing other
	parts of the program from having direct access to the state of the paddle
    <li>implement a set of functions for moving the paddle, setting paddle
	attributes, and reading paddle information
    <li>have a header file called <tt>paddle.h</tt> that contains declarations of
	the non-static functions in <tt>paddle.c</tt>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<b>Questions?</b>
<blockquote>
If you are not sure how to create a separate abstract object or layer in C, look at the
<tt>utmplib.c</tt> file from lecture 2.   Or send us email with specific questions about
your design.
</blockquote>

<b>General Modularity</b>
<blockquote>
Some of the regular design points on pong are based on applying this modular
approach to other objects in the system.  You can write <tt>ball.c</tt> and
</tt>ball.h</tt> files to implement the ball.  
</blockquote>

<b>Extra Credit</b>
<blockquote>
You can earn up ten points of extra credit by adding a significant addition to the game.
For example, you could allow several balls in the game at once, or you could allow the
paddle to move forward and backwards, or you could create a two-player game.  
Displaying the score or printing little messages is nice but is not a significant addition.
