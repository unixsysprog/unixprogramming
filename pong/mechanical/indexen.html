When Konrad Zuse began building the first computer in 1935, the world
was a different place.  The relentless advance of digital tecnology
had not yet begun, mechanics ruled the day.  So it is no surprise that 
Zuse's first computer was a mechanical computer.
The computer worked without electricity, it could be operated
with a hand crank.
With later machines, Zuse replaced individual parts with used telephone
relays, (first the arithmetic unit, later also the memory).
 <br><br>
A relay is a rather simple electromechanical component, which can have
two states.  It is thus ideally suitable for binary data.  
In addition, the workings of a telephone relay are openly visible and 
comprehensible to pepople without extenxive technical background.
The self-taught Zuse did not have an electronics background.  
But he had great powers of creativity.  
Thus, the relay was the natural building block for his computers.

      <div class="fliesstext"> Contrary to today's computers, Zuse's machines 
        did not hide their interior workings behind sheetmetal cases, but presented 
        it in a showcase. The switching of the relays was visible through glass 
        cabinet doors, and the associated clicking was loudly audible. Computations 
        developed a physical presence; one could literally experience the computer 
        when working. <br>
        <br>
Today's computers are designed as black boxes, as a system, which cannot 
readily be examined or understood.  
One can derive some of its behaviour by observing the inputs and outputs, 
but the actual workings remain hidden.  
I do not want to say that everyone could understand how Konrad Zuse's computers worked, 
but it was possible to watch and follow the job in a certain way.

<div class="fliesstext">
In 1972, Nolan Bushnell brought the first Pong to market to tremendous success.
The handling of the extremely abstract and independent digital version of a tennis 
play was to be understood captivatingly fast, and the play happened on a televsion
screen in real time - which so far had only served to illustrate reality.
<br><br>
        Over time, video games developed further mostly in <EM> one </EM>direction: 
        The virtual reality produced by the game becomes closer to what we are 
        accustomed to from television. The difference between a Playstation soccer 
        game and a TV soccer game is alreay small, and getting smaller with each 
        new generation of game console. A look back shows, how first color, then 
        pseudo three-dimensionality, and "genuine" three-dimensional illustration 
        was finally achieved. The development of sound ran in parallel: The monotonous 
        beeps of the early days yielded to full Surround sound.</div>

	<td width="340">
<div class="fliesstext">
<br>Nevertheless the interfaces remained largely unchanged.  
The game is still steered with a joystick, whose form does not have anything
to do with the game;  the play still happens as a two-dimensional illustration 
on a screen, and progress is limited more realistic graphics.
<br><br>
Still, this progress appears to enhance the gaming experience.  There are far
more modern games played than old games.  But pioneering games such as Pac Man or Pong 
achieve a new status:  
They are symbols of what defines a video game.</div>

<br><br><B> The Pongmechanik -<br>
Fascination with the original</B>
<br><br>
        The contrast of these two developments moving in opposite directions is 
        interesting: On one hand is there the computer, which extracted itself 
        from its physical operational roots to a gray box with invisible workings. 
        The circuits in it are so small and work so fast that computation is completely 
        separated from our perceptions. On the other hand the development of video 
        games tries to go the opposite direction with its uses for the computer: 
        The video game wants to separate itself from its abstract roots, and enter 
        the phyiscal world.<br>

Pongmechanik is an electromechanical conversion of the classical game Pong.  
And instead of more realistic graphics, it ever accurately to reproduces
the original Pong.  The user is hardly changed.  
However the game breaks open the Black box:  What takes place in the computer, 
becomes again perceptible and comprehensible.
<br><br>
Pongmechanik is an absolutely physical game.  
The game is realized electromechanically, and essentially consists of 
<EM> four elements:  </EM><br>
A relay computer, the mechanical movement with collision detection, 
the display and the acoustic components.<br><br>

The relay computer controls the game.  
It consists entirely of used telephone relays, no semiconductors such as transistors 
or microprocessors were used.  Contrary to modern electronic components, 
all operatins are visible and audible with the relays.
<br><br><EM> Element 2:  </EM> 
The movements of ball and racquet, as well as the collision detection take place 
in a metal chassis under the glass cover.  
Each moving game compoent has a mechanical counterpart, which is moved by electric 
motors.  When these parts collide, contacts are closed and the relays in the 
computer switch the direction of rotation of the motors.<br><br>

The movement of the mechanical parts is transferred via strings and guide 
pulleys to the display.  
The display consists of two closely spaced glass plates.  
The playing field is painted on the lower plate.  
The ball, represented by a white plastic square, is moved between the 
two plates by black string.  The raquets, represented by two white plastic rectangles,
are moved by string on the upper glass plate.
The score is shown by rotating discs visible through openings in the playing field.

<div class="fliesstext"><EM> Element 4:  </EM> 
The sound is produced by two wooden sound blocks, which are struck by the
core of two solenoids.  The computer controls both solenoids.
<br><br>
Together, these four elements produce an exact copy of the classical Pong.<br>
But there is more:<br>
The game is brought to a physically understandable and comprehensible level.  
Added to the game is the fascination of a comprehensible mechanism.  
The classical video game inspires two players.  Pongmechanik additionally pulls
otherwise indifferent spectators into its spell.  
They have the liberty to investigate the mechanics of the game in detail.<br><br><br>
