	 three balls to play.

	   Each of the object has its own header and source files. So there are
	   Total of six files -wall.h, wall.c, paddle.h, paddle.c, ball.c,ball.h
	   struct of these objects and access methods are declared in .h file
	   and respective source code (.c file) of these objects control the
