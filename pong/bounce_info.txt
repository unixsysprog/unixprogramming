The ball moves as follows:

	The timer ticks at a regular interval.
	Each time it ticks the 'ball_move' function
	is called.

	The way the speed of the ball is determined is
	there is a number called  'delay' that
	must elapse before the ball moves one screen
	position.  For example, if the ball is set at
	a delay of 10 in the x direction, then 
	after each 10 timer ticks pass, the horizontal
	position of the ball in increased.

	Similarly, there is a setting for the delay
	in the y direction.  Say that number is set
	at 7.  Then after each seven ticks, the ball
	moves one screen position in the vertical
	direction.

	How does the ball know how many ticks have passed
	since it last moved?  It uses a counter called
	count which keeps track of how many ticks
	are left before the ball moves in that direction.

	Therefore, when the ball starts, it sets x_count
	equal to x_delay and sets y_count = y_delay .
	At each timer tick, it decrements the x_count
	and y_count variables.  If x_count hits zero, then
	the ball is moved in the x-direction and the
	x_count variable is reset to x_delay.  Similarly
	if y_count hits zero, the ball is moved in the
	y direction and the counter (y_count) is reset
	to equal y_delay.

	How does the ball know whether to move left 
	or right?  It uses x_dir.  If x_dir is +1, the
	ball moves right each time it moves.  If
	x_dir is -1, the ball moves left each time it
	moves.  Same idea for y_dir.
