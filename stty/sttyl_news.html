	<p>
	When you are using the default version of the c-shell on this
	system, you can press the ESC key to edit previous commands.
	<p>
	You don't need to press Return, just ESC.  That means the tty
	is in cbreak mode.  If it were not in cbreak mode, the shell
	would not see you input until you pressed the Return key.
	<p>
	The csh uses the new tty driver, which is different from the
	standard one.
	<p>
	The Bourne shell, invoked by typing  sh  , does not do anything
	weird with the tty driver, but it does interpret the ^ character
	as if it were the | character.  ( Original Unix used ^ for
	pipelines rather than the | symbol.)
	<p>
	moral: use the bourne shell to test your program but quote the
	caret with  "^" or '^' or \^ to prevent the shell from 
	misinterpreting your meaning.
